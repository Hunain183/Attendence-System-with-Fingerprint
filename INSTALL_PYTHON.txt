   PYTHON VERSION ISSUE - PLEASE READ
============================================================

Your Python version (3.14) is too new and is not compatible 
with FastAPI and Pydantic yet.

You need to install Python 3.11 or 3.12 instead.

============================================================
   STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

1. Download Python 3.11:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
   
   Click on "Windows installer (64-bit)" at the bottom

2. Run the installer:
   - CHECK the box "Add Python to PATH"
   - Click "Install Now"

3. IMPORTANT: When asked "Modify, Repair, or Uninstall", 
   choose to KEEP your Python 3.14 if you need it for other projects,
   OR choose to uninstall it first.

4. After installation, open a NEW Command Prompt and verify:
   python --version
   
   It should show: Python 3.11.x

5. Then run the application:
   Double-click RUN_SIMPLE.bat

============================================================
   ALTERNATIVE: Use Python 3.12
============================================================

Python 3.12 also works:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3128/

============================================================
   WHY THIS HAPPENS
============================================================

Python 3.14 was released very recently and many Python 
packages (like FastAPI, Pydantic, etc.) have not been 
updated to support it yet.

Python 3.11 and 3.12 are stable and well-supported.
